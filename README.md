# recommender-system-python
Developed a recommendation system in Python using Netflix prize dataset and MovieLens data set using collaborative filtering technique to recommend movies to a user, based on their preferences.

INTRODUCTION:
Nowadays, recommender systems are used to personalize your experience on the web, telling you what to buy, where to eat or even who you should be friends with. People's tastes vary, but generally follow patterns. People tend to like things that are similar to other things they like, and they tend to have similar taste as other people they are close with. Recommender systems try to capture these patterns to help predict what else you might like. E-commerce, social media, video and online news platforms have been actively deploying their own recommender systems to help their customers to choose products more efficiently, which serves win-win strategy.

Two most ubiquitous types of recommender systems are Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering (CF). Collaborative filtering produces recommendations based on the knowledge of users’ attitude to items, that is it uses the “wisdom of the crowd” to recommend items. In contrast, content-based recommender systems focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on the similarity between them.

In general, Collaborative filtering (CF) is the workhorse of recommender engines. The algorithm has a very interesting property of being able to do feature learning on its own, which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use. CF can be divided into Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering and Model-Based Collaborative filtering. In this tutorial, you will implement Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD) and Memory-Based CF by computing cosine similarity.

You will use MovieLens dataset, which is one of the most common datasets used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies. You should add unzipped movielens dataset folder to your notebook directory.

CONCLUSION:
You can see how the model based and memory based collaborative filtering techniques differ by comparing their root mean square error values.
